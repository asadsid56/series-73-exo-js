# The Hill: JavaScript

Welcome to the JavaScript folder.

- Repository name: `73-javascript-exercises`
- Mode: `solo`
- Type of Challenge: `learning`
- Duration: `1-2 weeks`
- Deployment strategy: Not needed for these exercises

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this challenge you will:

- be able to code using **JavaScript**

## The Mission

The folder consists of 73 exercises, divided into 11 series.  
Don't be afraid of the number: most of these exercises are very short and focus on a particular aspect.  
The exercises follow one another in a _relatively_ logical way, but don't let one exercise stop you: go to the next, come back to it later.

> ‚òùÔ∏è Each exercise must be done.

> ü§ü **NOTE:** The exercises in series 9 are a little more complex, worth a try: they are good syntheses of the progress made.

### ES2015 What?

You will see very soon in your research that there is an "old" JavaScript and a "new" JavaScript, called ES6 or ES2015, but also ES2016, ES2017, ESNEXT etc.

What does it mean? Well, it would be a good idea to explain this mess in a watch - _wink, wink_ - but don't worry too much about it: for this exercices, you just have to remember that the current accepted standard is ES6+.

### Local server

Some exercises will require running the code on a _local server_ (this is generally a good practice that should always be used). Good news: we prepared for you small a local server to use from your command line called [s√®v√®](https://github.com/leny/seve).

Maybe you have already installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/) on your machines. If not, do it now ;).  
If you want to configure correctly the global settigs of npm [follow this article](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally#manually-change-npms-default-directory).

Then, use your terminal to _navigate_ to the folder where this README is and run the following commands:

    npm install
    npm start

If everything is right, your default browser will be opened on the address [localhost:8000](https://localhost:8000).

### Section 11

For the exercises using fetch you will need a _REST API_. We once again got you
covered with a little script to run said _API_ in _local_, follow the steps
below:

- open a terminal
- navigate to the folder where this README is
- run `npm run api`

From there you will have the _REST API_ running on _localhost_ on the port 3000.
